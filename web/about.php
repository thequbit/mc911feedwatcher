				<h3>About This Site</h3>
				<br>
				
				Anywhere within <a href="http://www.monroecounty.gov/">Monroe County, NY</a>, if you dial 911 from a land-line or cellular phone the call will be routed to the
				Monroe County <a href="http://www.monroecounty.gov/safety-ecd.php">dispatch center</a>.  This allows for 911 dispatches to have a higher level of control over what
				resources need to be dispatched to a call.  The dispatch center uses an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_9-1-1">E911</a> system that has the ability to 
				provide data about the 911 calls coming into the dispatch center.  Monroe County dispatch is kind enough to provide that data via an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> 
				file found <a href="http://www.monroecounty.gov/etc/911/rss.php">here</a>.<br>
				<br>
				The county does provide a nice interface for viewing currently being addressed 911 calls <a href="http://www.monroecounty.gov/safety-incidents">here</a>.  This tool is nice 
				to see current calls being addressed by the dispatches, however does not provide any history of incoming calls.  The dispatch center also uses a Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/monroe911">@monroe911</a>, 
				to tweet calls as they come into the dispatch center.  This allows for a running history of calls, however only provides the date and time of when the call came into
				the center, not any additional information regarding the call.<br>
				<br>
				The goal of this website is to provide an accurate history of all 911 calls that come into the Monroe County, NY 911 dispatch center that are provided to the public
				via the RSS feed on their website.  This website also provides additional meta data about each call that is not immediately available via the dispatch center website or
				the RSS feed.  This site is run out of the drive for maximizing open data with respect to Government.<br>
